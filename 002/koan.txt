# UrLISP

One day a macrolyte approached the master macrologist
Pi Mu and quoted to him a poem:

> The voices of torrents 
> are from one great LISP dialect, 
> the lions of the hills 
> are the pure body of McCarthy. 

Looking expectantly at Pi Mu the macrolyte exclaimed:

> Isn't that right?

Pi Mu looked at the macrolyte and, in a low tone, told him:

> It is
> ...
> But it's a pity to say so.
