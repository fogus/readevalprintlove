I'm working through the first issue of Read-Eval-Print-λove and am basically done, but have a bit more research to do around Common Lisp's macrolet (I have the first 6 installments outlined also). However, the first thing I can say about it and future issues is that it will not focus strictly on any particular member of the Lisp family. Additionally, I will at times (once per issue most likely) cover other languages in the Little-language category. What does that mean? I don't know yet, but again, that's not the primary focus. Most examples and programs will likely be in one of Common Lisp, Clojure and R7RS because I'm most familiar with those, but I'll expand to try and learn more myself.

Every issue of Read-Eval-Print-λove will be made available through this mailing list for FREE and through the http://www.readevalprintlove.org website, but I'm also exploring optional payment offerings through LeanPub (https://leanpub.com/). This payment option would be "pay what you wish, with a small minimum" and is intended to offer alternate formats only (i.e. epub, mobi, PDF). The content on the site/list and there will be exactly the same. I'm not doing this to get rich.
A high-level overview of the contents of the first issue are as follows:
Every issue will start with a Koan-style dialog (with accompanying artwork) between the Master Macrologist Π無 and one or more of his students (macrolytes). These will usually Lispy in nature, but not always, but in any case will set the theme of the issue.

 * I'll then talk about what defines a Lisp.
 * I'll also expand on an old idea that I explored before named Fluchtpunkt Lisp
 * I'll include a section (in the works) with the tentative title "A language that doesn't let you affect the way it thinks is not worth growing"
 * I'll also have a review of [Land of Lisp](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1593272812/?tag=fogus-20)
 * Finally I'll try to end on a fun note including goofy pictures and bombastic statements about the computing industry and programming languages.
So if the above sounds appealing then by all means subscribe away, but like I said the site will have the content as well, so it's your prerogative.
